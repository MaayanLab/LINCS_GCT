I'm using the python cmap l1k io tools to read the gct file - I'm specifically 
using Zichen's modified version. 

I'm only going to include categories that have unique values. I'm going to load 
the gct data into a pandas dataframe with tuple labels and my custom category 
title encoding (title: category) to pass the title of the category to the 
visualization. 

LDS-1207.gct: 
  There are 30 rows and 5 columns. The columns are the measurements that were 
  made for a perturbation (called id). The columns are the perturbations (data
  points) that were made. The main descriptor is the smName (small molecule name
  ). There is also the cell line name available - I'll make this a category.
